# Brainstorming for the project

## Motivation

[This pew report](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/01/11/among-u-s-latinos-the-internet-now-rivals-television-as-a-source-for-news/) demonstrates that the consumption of television news among Latinos in favor of internet news. The news report also suggests that, on the whole, Latinos rely on English-speakingnews. This is particularly the case for millennial Latinos. Immigrant Latinos tend to prefer watching Spanish-speaking news.

## Question

This leaves me with the question: what are the impacts of watching Spanish-speaking news for Latinos on their reported level of identity?

## Potential mechanisms

There are a few different causes affecting Latino identity (and whether they dissassociate to try to "Whiten" their identity):

-   Immigration and generation

-   Colorism

-   Wealth

-   Accepting a Colorblind ideology towards race

-   Exposure to negative depicitions of the group

-   Desire to connect themselves to higher status groups (Whites); some of this is because of exposure to rhetoric that paints the group in a negative light motivates a desire to dissassociate from the group (Gomez and Cowburn 2020; Bedolla 2003; Perez 2015; Gans 2012)

## Potential empirical approaches

### Content analysis

One idea is that it is not just that younger Latinos or those that are less connected to familial experiences with immigration are more likely to disassociate from a Latino identity, one key one is the idea that Latinos may just want to "Whitify" themselves to play up their connection to a high status racial group. This can happen through a few different mechanisms such as wealth, colorism, and exposure to negative depicitions of the group.

We might expect that there is lots more discussion of these negative depicitions of Latinos when watching English-speaking news outlets as they report on Trump (who has been shown to receive much more support from Latinos that have disassociated from their ethnic identity). We might expect that there is less content of Trump on these news sources; or at least there is much less use of language that he uses to denegrate Latinos.

The analysis here would be to see whether the content of english-speaking and spanish-speaking news is different in terms of the prevelence of reporting on denegrating language towards Latinos in spanish-speaking outlets relative to english-speaking outlets.

### Experiment

If these differences exist in a content analysis, we can really tackle the main question of the study here: are Latinos that watch this sort of reporting going to weaken ethnic linked fate and identity relative to news that doesn't cover it as much?

We can expose Latinos to english-speaking news that does this or to spanish-speaking news that does not do this and see whether that leads to systematic differences in reported identity among Latino participants.
